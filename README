NNCP (Node to Node copy) is a collection of utilities simplifying
secure store-and-forward files and mail exchanging.

This utilities are intended to help build up small size (dozens of
nodes) ad-hoc friend-to-friend (F2F) statically routed darknet networks
for fire-and-forget secure reliable files, file requests and Internet
mail transmission. All packets are integrity checked, end-to-end
encrypted (E2EE), explicitly authenticated by known participants public
keys. Onion encryption is applied to relayed packets. Each node acts
both as a client and server, can use push and poll behaviour model.

Out-of-box offline sneakernet/floppynet, dead drops and air-gapped
computers support. But online TCP daemon with full-duplex resumable data
transmission exists.

NNCP is copylefted free software: see the file COPYING for copying
conditions. It should work on all POSIX-compatible systems. Easy
integration with existing SMTP servers. Single YAML configuration file.
