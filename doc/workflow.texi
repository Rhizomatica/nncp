@node Workflow
@unnumbered Workflow

NNCP consists of several utilities. As a rule you will have the
following workflow:

@enumerate
@item Run @ref{nncp-newnode} on each node to create an initial
@ref{Configuration, configuration} file.
@item Tune it up and set at least @ref{Spool, spool} and log paths.
@item Share your public keys and reachability addressees with your
neighbours. Add their keys to your configuration file and do any other
required configuration about their reachability, permissions of file or
freq transmission.
@item Use @ref{nncp-file}, @ref{nncp-freq}, @ref{nncp-mail}
(@ref{Postfix, look how} Postfix SMTP server could be configured)
commands to queue file, freq and mail transmissions. Repeat as
many times any time as you wish.
@item Depending on connection methods, either:
    @itemize
    @item run @ref{nncp-daemon} to accept remotely initiated connections
    to your node
    @item run either @ref{nncp-call} or @ref{nncp-caller} to initiate
    connection to required nodes from time to time
    @item use @ref{nncp-xfer} with removable storage devices for copying
    packets to/from other nodes
    @end itemize
@item After successful packet exchanging (or just simply from time to
time), run @ref{nncp-toss} for tossing (decrypting and processing) all
inbound queues to receive mail messages, files, file requests and relay
transition packets to other nodes.
@end enumerate
