@node Sync
@unnumbered Synchronization protocol

So-called synchronization protocol (SP) is used in current TCP daemon's
implementation. It is used for synchronizing @ref{Spool, spool}
directory contents between two nodes.

It is aimed to be very simple and effective. It uses reliable transport
like TCP connections. It must be effective both on single-duplex and
full-duplex links: for example satellites have very high throughput but
high-delay links, so acknowledging of each received packet, like
@url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMODEM, XMODEM} does, causes
unacceptable performance degradation.

SP works on top of
@url{http://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html#interactive-patterns,
@code{Noise_IK_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2b}} protocol. Each Noise packet
are sent inside XDR envelope:

@verbatim
+-----------------+
| MAGIC | PAYLOAD |
+-----------------+
@end verbatim

@multitable @columnfractions 0.2 0.3 0.5
@headitem  @tab XDR type @tab Value
@item Magic number @tab
    8-byte, fixed length opaque data @tab
    @code{NNCPS0x00x00x01}
@item Payload @tab
    variable length opaque data @tab
    Noise packet itself
@end multitable

Peers static keys are specified as @ref{Configuration, @code{noisepub}}
configuration entry.

Payload inside Noise packets has maximum size of @code{65 KiB - 256 B =
65280 B}. It is sent immediately in the first message by each side. The
very first payload (that is carried inside handshake messages) is always
padded to the maximum size with @code{HALT} packets (read below), for
hiding actual number of @code{INFO} packets (number of files available
for transmission).

Each SP payload is a concatenation of SP packets. Each packet has
XDR-encoded header and then corresponding XDR-encoded body. Header is
just an unsigned integer telling what body structure follows.

@table @code

@item HALT
    Stop file transmission, empty sending queue on the remote side.
    Actually @code{HALT} packet does not have any body, only the header
    with the type. It is also used in the first payload for padding to
    the maximum size.
@verbatim

@item INFO
    Information about the file we have for transmission.
