Make sure that Go is installed. For example to install it from packages:

@table @asis
@item FreeBSD
    @verb{|pkg install go|}
@item Debian, Ubuntu
    @verb{|apt install golang|}
@end table

@example
$ [fetch|wget] http://www.nncpgo.org/download/nncp-@value{VERSION}.tar.xz
$ [fetch|wget] http://www.nncpgo.org/download/nncp-@value{VERSION}.tar.xz.sig
$ gpg --verify nncp-@value{VERSION}.tar.xz.sig nncp-@value{VERSION}.tar.xz
$ xz --decompress --stdout nncp-@value{VERSION}.tar.xz | tar xf -
$ cd nncp-@value{VERSION}
$ redo all
@end example

After that you should get various @command{bin/nncp-*} binaries and
@command{bin/hjson-cli} command (only for your convenience, not
necessary installation). For example, documentation for
@command{nncp-bundle} command can be get with
@command{info doc/nncp.info -n nncp-bundle}.

It uses @url{http://cr.yp.to/redo.html, redo} build system for that
examples. You can use one of its various implementations, or at least
minimalistic POSIX shell @command{contrib/do} (just replace
@command{redo} with @command{contrib/do} in the example above) included
in tarball. Following ones are tested to work with:
@url{http://www.goredo.cypherpunks.ru/, goredo} (NNCP's author creation),
@url{https://redo.readthedocs.io/, apenwarr/redo} (@code{contrib/do} is
from that project), @url{https://github.com/leahneukirchen/redo-c, redo-c},
@url{https://github.com/gotroyb127/baredo, baredo}.

There is @command{install} target respecting @env{$DESTDIR}. It will
install binaries and info-documentation:

@example
# PREFIX=/usr/local redo install
@end example

NNCP depends on @code{github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify} library, that is
solely relies on OS-specific mechanisms. There is possibility that you
have either broken or unsupported ones. You can still build NNCP with
@code{-tags nofsnotify} build option, to skip @code{fsnotify} library
usage at all.
