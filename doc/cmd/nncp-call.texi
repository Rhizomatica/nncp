@end example

Call (connect to) specified @option{NODE} and run @ref{Sync,
synchronization} protocol with the @ref{nncp-daemon, daemon} on the
remote side. Normally this command could be run any time you wish to
either check for incoming packets, or to send out queued ones.
Synchronization protocol allows resuming and bidirectional packets
transfer.

If @option{-rx} option is specified then only inbound packets
transmission is performed. If @option{-tx} option is specified, then
only outbound transmission is performed.

@option{-onlinedeadline} overrides @ref{CfgOnlineDeadline, @emph{onlinedeadline}}.
@option{-maxonlinetime} overrides @ref{CfgMaxOnlineTime, @emph{maxonlinetime}}.
@option{-rxrate}/@option{-txrate} override @ref{CfgXxRate, rxrate/txrate}.

@option{-list} option allows you to list packets of remote node, without
any transmission. You can specify what packets your want to download, by
specifying @option{-pkts} option with comma-separated list of packets
identifiers.

Each @option{NODE} can contain several uniquely identified
@option{ADDR}esses in @ref{CfgAddrs, configuration} file. If you do
not specify the exact one, then all will be tried until the first
success. Optionally you can force @option{FORCEADDR} address usage,
instead of addresses taken from configuration file. You can specify both
@verb{|host:port|} and @verb{#|some command#} formats.

If you specify @option{-ucspi} option, then it is assumed that you run
@command{nncp-call} command under some UCSPI-TCP compatible utility,
that provides read/write channels through 6/7 file descriptors.

@option{-autotoss} option runs tosser on node's spool every second
during the call. All @option{-autotoss-*} options is the same as in
@ref{nncp-toss} command.

Partly downloaded packets are stored in @file{.part} files. By default
all downloaded files are sequentially checksummed in the background,
stripping @file{.part} extension if is successful. If @option{-nock}
option is set, then no checksumming is done, renaming fully downloaded
files to @file{.nock} extension. Pay attention that checksumming can be
time consuming and connection could be lost during that check, so remote
node won't be notified that the file is finished. If you run
@ref{nncp-check, @command{nncp-check -nock}}, that will checksum files
and strip the @file{.nock} extension, then repeated call to remote node
will notify about packet's completion. Also it will be notified if
@ref{nncp-toss, tossing} created @file{.seen} file.
Read @ref{CfgNoCK, more} about @option{-nock} option.
